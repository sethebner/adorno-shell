This shell implements some useful command combinations, including:

- `bl` replaces `cd ..; ls`
- `cdl foo` replaces `cd foo; ls`

as well as some command shortcuts, such as:

- `b` replaces `cd ..`  
- `c` to clear the screen
- `e foo` to open `foo` in emacs
- `l` to list the current directory's contents
- `v foo` to open `foo` in vi

This shell is adapted from Stephen Brennan's shell available [here](https://github.com/brenns10/lsh).
